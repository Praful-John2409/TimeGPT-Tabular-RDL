## Repository Structure

### 1. **TimeGPT**
This folder contains Colab notebooks demonstrating the various use cases of TimeGPT, a powerful time-series forecasting tool. The notebooks include:

- **[Multivariate Forecasting](https://colab.research.google.com/github/your-repo/TimeGPT/Multivariate_Forecasting.ipynb)**  
  Demonstrates forecasting for multiple time series with long horizons.  

- **[Fine-Tuning with Custom Data](https://colab.research.google.com/github/your-repo/TimeGPT/Fine_Tuning.ipynb)**  
  Shows how to fine-tune TimeGPT on your dataset for better accuracy.  

- **[Anomaly Detection](https://colab.research.google.com/github/your-repo/TimeGPT/Anomaly_Detection.ipynb)**  
  Identifies anomalies in time-series data using TimeGPT.  

- **[Energy Forecasting](https://colab.research.google.com/github/your-repo/TimeGPT/Energy_Forecasting.ipynb)**  
  Predicts energy demand using TimeGPT.  

- **[Bitcoin Price Prediction](https://colab.research.google.com/github/your-repo/TimeGPT/Bitcoin_Forecasting.ipynb)**  
  Leverages TimeGPT to forecast Bitcoin prices.

### 2. **Tabular**
This folder demonstrates Tabular data capabilities, focusing on synthetic data generation and zero-shot inference:

- **[Synthetic Data Generation](https://colab.research.google.com/github/your-repo/Tabular/Synthetic_Data_Generation.ipynb)**  
  Generates synthetic datasets to simulate real-world data.

- **[Zero-Shot Inference](https://colab.research.google.com/github/your-repo/Tabular/Zero_Shot_Inference.ipynb)**  
  Performs zero-shot inference using Tabula models.

---

### 3. **RDL and RelBench**
This folder demonstrates the use of Relational Deep Learning (RDL) with RelBench for tabular prediction tasks:

- **[GNN-Based Model for Tabular Prediction](https://colab.research.google.com/github/your-repo/RDL_and_RelBench/GNN_Tabular_Prediction.ipynb)**  
  Trains a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model on tabular datasets and evaluates its performance.
